# **ConnectInterface**
> BankConnection ConnectInterface(ctx, body)
Connect a new interface

Connects new interface to an existing bank connection for a specific user. Must pass the connection credentials and the user's access_token. All bank accounts will be downloaded and imported with their current balances, transactions and supported two-step-procedures (note that the amount of available transactions may vary between banks, e.g. some banks deliver all transactions from the past year, others only deliver the transactions from the past three months). The balance and transactions download process runs asynchronously, so this service may return before all balances and transactions have been imported. Also, all downloaded transactions will be categorized by a separate background process that runs asynchronously too. To check the status of the balance and transactions download process as well as the background categorization process, see the status flags that are returned by the GET /bankConnections/<id> service.<br/><br/>NOTE: Depending on your license, this service may respond with HTTP code 451, containing an error message with a identifier of web form in it. In addition to that the response will also have included a 'Location' header, which contains the URL to the web form. In this case, you must forward your user to finAPI's web form. For a detailed explanation of the Web Form Flow, please refer to this article: <a href='https://finapi.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002596391' target='_blank'>finAPI's Web Form Flow</a>

Connections whose identifiers do not exist or do not relate to the authorized user will not be contained in the result (If this applies to all of the given identifiers, then the result will be an empty list).

# **ImportBankConnection**
> BankConnection ImportBankConnection(ctx, body)
Import a new bank connection

Imports a new bank connection for a specific user. Must pass the connection credentials and the user's access_token. All bank accounts will be downloaded and imported with their current balances, transactions and supported two-step-procedures (note that the amount of available transactions may vary between banks, e.g. some banks deliver all transactions from the past year, others only deliver the transactions from the past three months). The balance and transactions download process runs asynchronously, so this service may return before all balances and transactions have been imported. Also, all downloaded transactions will be categorized by a separate background process that runs asynchronously too. To check the status of the balance and transactions download process as well as the background categorization process, see the status flags that are returned by the GET /bankConnections/<id> service.<br/><br/>You can also import a \"demo connection\" which contains a single bank account with some pre-defined transactions. To import the demo connection, you need to pass the identifier of the \"finAPI Test Bank\". In case of demo connection import, any other fields besides the bank identifier can remain unset. The bankingUserId, bankingCustomerId, bankingPin, and storeSecrets fields will be stored if you pass them, however they will not be regarded when updating the demo connection (in other words: It doesn't matter what credentials you choose for the demo connection). Note however that if you want to import the demo connection multiple times for the same user, you must use a different bankingUserId and/or bankingCustomerId for each of the imports. Also note that the skipPositionsDownload flag is ignored for the demo bank connection, i.e. when importing the demo bank connection, you will always get the transactions for its account. You can enable multi-step authentication for the demo bank connection by setting the bank connection name to \"MSA\".<br/><br/><b>For a more in-depth understanding of the import process, please also read this article on our Dev Portal: <a href='https://finapi.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000296607-Import-Update-of-Bank-Connections-Accounts' target='_blank'>Import & Update of Bank Connections / Accounts</a></b><br/><br/>NOTE: Depending on your license, this service may respond with HTTP code 451, containing an error message with a identifier of web form in it.

Now any import or update of a bank connection will only fetch the last three months of transactions per account, regardless if maxDaysForDownload is defined or not. We're working of fixing this behaviour by implementing the multi step authentication workflow for FinTS.
