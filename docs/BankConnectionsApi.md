## ConnectInterface

> BankConnection ConnectInterface(ctx).ConnectInterfaceParams(connectInterfaceParams).PSUIPAddress(pSUIPAddress).PSUDeviceOS(pSUDeviceOS).PSUUserAgent(pSUUserAgent).XRequestId(xRequestId).Execute()

Connect a new interface



### Example

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "os"
    openapiclient "./openapi"
)

func main() {
    connectInterfaceParams := *openapiclient.NewConnectInterfaceParams(int64(1), openapiclient.BankingInterface("WEB_SCRAPER")) // ConnectInterfaceParams | Connect interface parameters
    pSUIPAddress := "pSUIPAddress_example" // string | The IP address of the user's device. This header will be forwarded to the bank if the 'XS2A' interface is used. (optional)
    pSUDeviceOS := "pSUDeviceOS_example" // string | The user's device and/or operating system identification. This header will be forwarded to the bank if the 'XS2A' interface is used. (optional)
    pSUUserAgent := "pSUUserAgent_example" // string | The user's web browser or other client device identification. This header will be forwarded to the bank if the 'XS2A' interface is used. (optional)
    xRequestId := "xRequestId_example" // string | With any API call, you can pass a request ID. The request ID can be an arbitrary string with up to 255 characters. Passing a longer string will result in an error. If you don't pass a request ID for a call, finAPI will generate a random ID internally. The request ID is always returned back in the response of a service, as a header with name 'X-Request-Id'. We highly recommend to always pass a (preferably unique) request ID, and include it into your client application logs whenever you make a request or receive a response (especially in the case of an error response). finAPI is also logging request IDs on its end. Having a request ID can help the finAPI support team to work more efficiently and solve tickets faster. (optional)

    configuration := openapiclient.NewConfiguration()
    api_client := openapiclient.NewAPIClient(configuration)
    resp, r, err := api_client.BankConnectionsApi.ConnectInterface(context.Background()).ConnectInterfaceParams(connectInterfaceParams).PSUIPAddress(pSUIPAddress).PSUDeviceOS(pSUDeviceOS).PSUUserAgent(pSUUserAgent).XRequestId(xRequestId).Execute()
    if err != nil {

    resp, r, err := api_client.BankConnectionsApi.GetBankConnection(context.Background(), id).XRequestId(xRequestId).Execute()

### Path Parameters


Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ctx** | **context.Context** | context for authentication, logging, cancellation, deadlines, tracing, etc.
**id** | **int64** | Identifier of requested bank connection | 

### Other Parameters

Other parameters are passed through a pointer to a apiGetBankConnectionRequest struct via the builder pattern


Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------

 **xRequestId** | **string** | With any API call, you can pass a request ID. The request ID can be an arbitrary string with up to 255 characters. Passing a longer string will result in an error. If you don&#39;t pass a request ID for a call, finAPI will generate a random ID internally. The request ID is always returned back in the response of a service, as a header with name &#39;X-Request-Id&#39;. We highly recommend to always pass a (preferably unique) request ID, and include it into your client application logs whenever you make a request or receive a response (especially in the case of an error response). finAPI is also logging request IDs on its end. Having a request ID can help the finAPI support team to work more efficiently and solve tickets faster. | 

### Return type

### Authorization

[finapi_auth](../README.md#finapi_auth), [finapi_auth](../README.md#finapi_auth)
