## CreateLabel

> Label CreateLabel(ctx).LabelParams(labelParams).XRequestId(xRequestId).Execute()

Create a new label



### Example

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "os"
    openapiclient "./openapi"
)

func main() {
    labelParams := *openapiclient.NewLabelParams("test") // LabelParams | Label's name
    xRequestId := "xRequestId_example" // string | With any API call, you can pass a request ID. The request ID can be an arbitrary string with up to 255 characters. Passing a longer string will result in an error. If you don't pass a request ID for a call, finAPI will generate a random ID internally. The request ID is always returned back in the response of a service, as a header with name 'X-Request-Id'. We highly recommend to always pass a (preferably unique) request ID, and include it into your client application logs whenever you make a request or receive a response (especially in the case of an error response). finAPI is also logging request IDs on its end. Having a request ID can help the finAPI support team to work more efficiently and solve tickets faster. (optional)

    configuration := openapiclient.NewConfiguration()
    api_client := openapiclient.NewAPIClient(configuration)
    resp, r, err := api_client.LabelsApi.CreateLabel(context.Background()).LabelParams(labelParams).XRequestId(xRequestId).Execute()
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Error when calling `LabelsApi.CreateLabel``: %v\n", err)
        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Full HTTP response: %v\n", r)
    }
    // response from `CreateLabel`: Label
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stdout, "Response from `LabelsApi.CreateLabel`: %v\n", resp)

If no labels contain the search string in their name, then the result will be an empty list. NOTE: If the given search string consists of several terms (separated by whitespace), then ALL of these terms must be contained in the name for a label to get included into the result. (optional)
    page := int32(56) // int32 | Result page that you want to retrieve (optional) (default to 1)
    perPage := int32(56) // int32 | Maximum number of records per page. By default it's 20. Can be at most 500. (optional) (default to 20)
    order := []string{"Inner_example"} // []string | Determines the order of the results. You can order the results by 'id' or 'name'. The default order for all services is 'id,asc'.
