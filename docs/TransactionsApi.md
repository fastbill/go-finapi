### Optional Parameters
Optional parameters are passed through a pointer to a DeleteAllTransactionsOpts struct

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **maxDeletionDate** | **optional.String**| If specified, then only those transactions are being deleted whose &#39;finapiBookingDate&#39; is equal to or earlier to the given date.

# **EditMultipleTransactions**

Edit multiple transactions

Edit one or multiple transactions. You can edit the following fields: 'isNew=true|false' and/or 'isPotentialDuplicate=false' and/or 'categoryId=<id>' and/or 'labelIds=[<ids>]'. To clear the category of the given transactions (so that they are no longer categorized), pass the value '0' as the categoryId. To clear the labels of the given transactions, pass an empty array of label identifiers: '[]'. The parameters 'categoryId' and 'labelIds' are forbidden if 'ids' is NOT set (i.e. you cannot update the category or labels for ALL transactions).

# **GetAndSearchAllTransactions**
> PageableTransactionList GetAndSearchAllTransactions(ctx, view, optional)
Get and search all transactions

Get transactions of the user that is authorized by the access_token. Must pass the user's access_token. You can set optional search criteria to get only those transactions that you are interested in. If you do not specify any search criteria, then this service functions as a 'get all' service.

### Required Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **ctx** | **context.Context** | context for authentication, logging, cancellation, deadlines, tracing, etc.
  **view** | **string**| This parameter defines finAPI&#39;s logical view on the transactions when querying them: &#39;bankView&#39; regards only the original transactions as they were received from the bank, without considering how the transactions might have gotten split by the user (see POST /transactions/&lt;id&gt;/split). This means that if a transaction is split into logical sub-transactions, then the service will still regard only the original transaction, and NOT the logical sub-transactions in its processing (though for convenience, the transactions will have the data of their sub-transactions included in the response). &#39;userView&#39; by contrast regards the transactions as they exist for the user. For transactions that have not been split into logical sub-transactions, there is no difference to the \&quot;bankView\&quot;. But for transaction that have been split into logical sub-transactions, the service will ONLY regard these sub-transactions, and not the originally received transaction (though for convenience, the sub-transactions will have the identifier of their original transaction included in the response). | 
 **optional** | ***GetAndSearchAllTransactionsOpts** | optional parameters | nil if no parameters

### Optional Parameters
Optional parameters are passed through a pointer to a GetAndSearchAllTransactionsOpts struct

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------

 **ids** | [**optional.Interface of []int64**](int64.md)| A comma-separated list of transaction identifiers. If specified, then only transactions whose identifier match any of the given identifiers will be regarded. The maximum number of identifiers is 1000. | 
 **search** | **optional.String**| If specified, then only those transactions will be contained in the result whose &#39;purpose&#39; or counterpart fields contain the given search string (the matching works case-insensitive). If no transactions contain the search string in any of these fields, then the result will be an empty list. NOTE: If the given search string consists of several terms (separated by whitespace), then ALL of these terms must be contained in the searched fields in order for a transaction to get included into the result. | 
 **counterpart** | **optional.String**| If specified, then only those transactions will be contained in the result whose counterpart fields contain the given search string (the matching works case-insensitive). If no transactions contain the search string in any of the counterpart fields, then the result will be an empty list. NOTE: If the given search string consists of several terms (separated by whitespace), then ALL of these terms must be contained in the searched fields in order for a transaction to get included into the result. | 
 **purpose** | **optional.String**| If specified, then only those transactions will be contained in the result whose purpose field contains the given search string (the matching works case-insensitive). If no transactions contain the search string in the purpose field, then the result will be an empty list.

 **direction** | **optional.String**| If specified, then only transactions with the given direction(s) will be regarded. Use &#39;income&#39; for regarding only received payments (amount &gt;&#x3D; 0), &#39;spending&#39; for regarding only outgoing payments (amount &lt; 0), or &#39;all&#39; to regard both directions.

 **maxImportDate** | **optional.String**| Upper bound for a transaction&#39;s import date, in the format &#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39; (e.g. &#39;2016-01-01&#39;). If specified, then only transactions whose &#39;importDate&#39; is equal to or earlier than the given date will be regarded. | 
 **page** | **optional.Int32**| Result page that you want to retrieve. | [default to 1]
 **perPage** | **optional.Int32**| Maximum number of records per page. Can be at most 500. NOTE: Due to its validation and visualization, the swagger frontend might show very low performance, or even crashes, when a service responds with a lot of data. It is recommended to use a HTTP client like Postman or DHC instead of our swagger frontend for service calls with large page sizes. | [default to 20]
 **order** | [**optional.Interface of []string**](string.md)| Determines the order of the results. You can use the following fields for ordering the response: &#39;id&#39;, &#39;parentId&#39;, &#39;accountId&#39;, &#39;valueDate&#39;, &#39;bankBookingDate&#39;, &#39;finapiBookingDate&#39;, &#39;amount&#39;, &#39;purpose&#39;, &#39;counterpartName&#39;, &#39;counterpartAccountNumber&#39;, &#39;counterpartIban&#39;, &#39;counterpartBlz&#39;, &#39;counterpartBic&#39;, &#39;type&#39;, &#39;primanota&#39;, &#39;category.id&#39;, &#39;category.name&#39;, &#39;isPotentialDuplicate&#39;, &#39;isNew&#39; and &#39;importDate&#39;. The default order for all services is &#39;id,asc&#39;. You can also order by multiple properties. In that case the order of the parameters passed is important. Example: &#39;/transactions?order&#x3D;finapiBookingDate,desc&amp;order&#x3D;counterpartName&#39; will return the latest transactions first. If there are more transactions on the same day, then these transactions are ordered by the counterpart name (ascending). The general format is: &#39;property[,asc|desc]&#39;, with &#39;asc&#39; being the default value. Please note that ordering by multiple fields is not supported in our swagger frontend, but you can test this feature with any HTTP tool of your choice (e.g. postman or DHC).  |

# **TriggerCategorization**
> TriggerCategorization(ctx, body)
Trigger categorization

Triggers finAPI's background categorization process for all uncategorized transactions of the given bank connection(s) (or of all of the user's bank connections, if no bank connection identifiers are passed). The service returns as soon as the categorizations are scheduled. At this point, the bank connections will have their 'categorizationStatus' set to 'PENDING'. Use the service \"Get a bank connection\" or \"Get all bank connections\" to check when the categorization has finished (this is the case when the categorizationStatus has switched to 'READY').<br/><br/>Note that if at least one of the target bank connections is currently locked at the time when you call this service (i.e. the bank connection is currently being updated, or another categorization is already scheduled for it), then no categorization will be triggered at all and the service will respond with HTTP code 422.<br/><br/>Please also note:<br/>&bull; finAPI's background categorization process is executed automatically whenever you import or update a bank connection (though in case of update, it will categorize only the new transactions, and not re-run categorization for previously imported transactions). This means that in general you do not have to call this service after an import or update. Use this service only when you wish to re-run the categorization of all existing uncategorized transactions.<br/>&bull; if you wish to just manually assign categories to transactions, please use the service \"Edit a transaction\" or \"Edit multiple transactions\" instead.

### Required Parameters
