## CreateUser

> User CreateUser(ctx).UserCreateParams(userCreateParams).XRequestId(xRequestId).Execute()

Create a new user



### Example

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "os"
    openapiclient "./openapi"
)

func main() {
    userCreateParams := *openapiclient.NewUserCreateParams() // UserCreateParams | User's details
    xRequestId := "xRequestId_example" // string | With any API call, you can pass a request ID. The request ID can be an arbitrary string with up to 255 characters. Passing a longer string will result in an error. If you don't pass a request ID for a call, finAPI will generate a random ID internally. The request ID is always returned back in the response of a service, as a header with name 'X-Request-Id'. We highly recommend to always pass a (preferably unique) request ID, and include it into your client application logs whenever you make a request or receive a response (especially in the case of an error response). finAPI is also logging request IDs on its end. Having a request ID can help the finAPI support team to work more efficiently and solve tickets faster. (optional)

    configuration := openapiclient.NewConfiguration()
    api_client := openapiclient.NewAPIClient(configuration)
    resp, r, err := api_client.UsersApi.CreateUser(context.Background()).UserCreateParams(userCreateParams).XRequestId(xRequestId).Execute()
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Error when calling `UsersApi.CreateUser``: %v\n", err)
        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Full HTTP response: %v\n", r)

func main() {
    userId := "userId_example" // string | User's identifier
    xRequestId := "xRequestId_example" // string | With any API call, you can pass a request ID. The request ID can be an arbitrary string with up to 255 characters. Passing a longer string will result in an error. If you don't pass a request ID for a call, finAPI will generate a random ID internally. The request ID is always returned back in the response of a service, as a header with name 'X-Request-Id'. We highly recommend to always pass a (preferably unique) request ID, and include it into your client application logs whenever you make a request or receive a response (especially in the case of an error response). finAPI is also logging request IDs on its end. Having a request ID can help the finAPI support team to work more efficiently and solve tickets faster. (optional)
