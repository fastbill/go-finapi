package finapi

// Container for a bank's login credential field
type BankInterfaceLoginField struct {
	// Contains a German label for the input field that you should provide to the user. Also, these labels are used to identify login fields on the API-level, when you pass credentials to the service.
	Label string `json:"label"`
	// Whether this field has to be treated as a secret. In this case your application should use a password input field instead of a cleartext field.
	IsSecret bool `json:"isSecret"`
	// This field depicts whether the given credential is volatile. If a field is volatile, it means that the value for the field, which is provided by the user, is valid only for a single authentication and then gets invalidated on bank-side. If a login credential field is volatile, it is not possible to store it in finAPI, as stored credentials will never work for future authentications.
	IsVolatile bool `json:"isVolatile"`
