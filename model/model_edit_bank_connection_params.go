If any of those two fields is used, then the value of this field will be ignored.<br><br>New online banking user ID. If you do not want to change the current user ID let this field remain unset. In case you need to use finAPI's web form to let the user update the field, just set the field to any value, so that the service recognizes that you wish to use the web form flow.

If you do not want to change the current customer ID let this field remain unset. In case you need to use finAPI's web form to let the user update the field, just set the field to non-empty value, so that the service recognizes that you wish to use the web form flow.
